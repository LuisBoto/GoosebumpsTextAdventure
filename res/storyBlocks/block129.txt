T=The Monster Blood has grown so big — now you can’t see over it or around it. 

T=“Run for your lives!” Patty screams. But reaching the door is impossible. 

T=The mound of green slime is bearing down on you. 
T=Fast! You stand frozen to the spot. Terrified. 
T=And then — just in time — you, Patty, and Brad leap to the side. 
T=And the Monster Blood slams into the wall with a crushing force — and plows right through it. 

T=You stare at the giant gaping hole in the wall. 
T=Quickly, the three of you jump through the opening. 
T=You are standing outside the main gate — where you came in! 

T=There’s a wide path of destruction across the field and the forest beyond. 
T=From somewhere, a clock chimes twelve times, sending a chill down your spine. 
T=And when you peer back at the carnival, it has disappeared. 
T=All that’s left is a spooky silver mist. 


E=THE END
