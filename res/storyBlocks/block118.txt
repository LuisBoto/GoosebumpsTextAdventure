T=You turn left. Somewhere ahead of you, you hear laughter. 

T=“Is somebody there?” you call out. 

T=Silence. 

T=You stare at your reflections in the mirrored hall. 

T=Am I trapped? you wonder. Am I in real danger? 
T=Or is this all a big, scary joke? 
T=Your heart begins to race. 

T=You inch forward a few more steps — moving toward the laughter. 
T=Slowly. 
T=“Over here,” a voice calls again. 
T=But now the voice seems to be coming from behind you! 
E=HELP!
C=36
