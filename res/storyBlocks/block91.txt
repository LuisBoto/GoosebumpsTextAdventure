T=The red-eyed beast leans against you now, pressing you hard against the wall. 
T=The monster moves his face close to yours. 
T=The jagged horns at the top of his head nick your cheeks. 

T=You can’t bear it anymore. 
T=You bring your hand up with all your might and shove his head away from yours. 

T=As you watch in horror, the monster’s head rolls off its neck. 
T=The head tumbles to the floor and lands at your feet. 

T=The eyes glance up at you, and you notice his hideous lips moving. 
T=“That hurt,” the head says. “That really h-h-...” 

T=He never finishes. You’ve destroyed another robot! 

T=“Almost out of here,” you whisper to yourself.
T=Now all you have to do is slip by the crusty, alligator-snout creature guarding the door. 

T=“You robots aren’t so tough,” you say to him with fake bravery. 

T=“Oh, really?” the scaly beast croaks. 
T=“Well, maybe not. But what makes you think that I am a robot?”
