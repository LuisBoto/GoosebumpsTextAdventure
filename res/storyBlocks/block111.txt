T=Your pulse pounds in your ears as you carefully lift yourself out of the car. 
T=The tunnel is dark and musty and really creepy. 
T=Anything could be lurking in the shadows. 

T=This must be part of the ride, you reason. 
T=And the more you think about it, the more convinced you are. 
T=You’re scared. But you have to admit, this is pretty cool. 

T=In the distance, you spot several red lights that seem to lead to other dimly lit tunnels. 
T=You cautiously head toward one of them. Overhead something dark and slimy drips. 
T=Splattering on the top of your head. Stinging your forehead. 

T=As you desperately try to wipe the burning slime away, something grabs you by the knees! 

T=Aaaah! You look down. A pair of red-rimmed eyes meet yours. 
T=It’s a dwarf with scraggly red hair and a toothless smile. 

T=“Want me to lead you out of here, kid?” he asks. 
T=You’re about to follow the dwarf, but then you stop. 
T=Is he part of the ride? He looks really evil. 
Q=What do you do? > follow the dwarf_99/not follow him_33
