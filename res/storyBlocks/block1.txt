T=“What do you want to do?”
T=“I don’t know, Patty. What do you want to do?”
T=“Not fair, Brad. I asked you first.”
T=Patty and Brad. Your two best friends. Arguing. As usual. It’s the last week of August.
T=And Patty and Brad haven’t stopped fighting since your summer vacation started.
T=Patty likes being bossy. You don’t mind, though. It’s no big deal.
T=It’s hard to win a fight with her anyway. You don’t know why Brad even tries.
T=You guess it’s because he doesn’t want to look like a wimp in front of a girl.
T=“There’s nothing to do. I guess I’ll just go home,” Brad says.
T=He shoves his hands in his pockets. Then his shoulders slump and he sort of shrivels up.
T=You guess Brad is kind of a wimp — even if he is your best friend.
T=“You’re so boring, Brad,” Patty complains.
T=Whenever Patty complains, her freckles really pop out.
T=Now there are about a million of them spread across her face.
T=“Hey! I know what we should do!” Patty suddenly bursts out.
