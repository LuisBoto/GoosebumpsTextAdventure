T=You squint hard at the road ahead of you — and see why Patty wants you to turn. 
T=There they are — the people in the old-fashioned clothes. 
T=Only they don’t look the same. 

T=Some have green flesh. Some are deathly white. 
T=Their rotting skin hangs from their bones. 

T=And they’re all reaching out. Reaching out for you! 

T=“Turn! Turn!” Patty yells. 

T=You spin the wheel sharply to the left to avoid them. 
T=But you can’t dodge the ghostly creature that’s rising above you. 
T=He’s ten feet tall — with arms so long that they scrape the ground. 
T=His mouth gapes open to reveal hundreds of blackened, rotting teeth. 

T=He swoops down at you. You turn the steering wheel hard to the right. 
T=Too hard — it comes off in your hands! 

T=“Jump!” you cry. “Jump and run! Run!” 

T=The three of you leap out of the moving car. But are you fast enough? 
T=That depends on how good your reflexes are. 

T=Try this test and find out. Throw a ball in the air. 
T=Try to clap three times before you catch it.
Q=Were you able to do it? > y_73/n_127
