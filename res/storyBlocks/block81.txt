T=You quickly reach up with both hands and tug at his head. 
T=His sharp jaws slash at you. But you’re fast. You hold on firmly and pull! 

T=Oh, no! He really is a monster. And he’s not happy.

T=Just to make sure. You give his head one more tug. He laughs. 
T=Then he gives your head a tug. 

T=Sorry. You were doing so well. But now you’ve gone and lost your head.

T=Is to close the book and begin another day. 
T=At least then — you’ll have a head start. 

E=THE END
