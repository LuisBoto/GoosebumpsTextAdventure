T=You run to the right. “Follow me!” you cry out to Patty and Brad. 

T=You run faster than you’ve ever run in your life. Your sides ache, but you keep on going. 

T=When your chest feels as if it’s about to burst, you finally stop. 
T=And hear a crash behind you. Then at both sides of you. Then in front of you. Trapping you. 

T=“Welcome to the Reptile’s Petting Zoo,” a deep voice echoes through the darkness. 

T=Reptile’s Petting Zoo? You thought the sign said Reptile Petting Zoo. 

T=“Our alligator has been so lonely,” the deep voice continues. 
T=“Waiting and waiting — for his new pets to arrive. And here you are — finally.”
