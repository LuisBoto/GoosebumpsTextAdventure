T=Your reflexes are great. You jumped out fast enough and escaped the ghost — that ghost. 
T=But you didn’t see the other one behind the car — waiting for you. 

T=Your heart hammers away in your chest as it circles you. 
T=Around and around and around. 

T=“It’s all right,” you tell yourself over and over. 
T=“It’s not real. This is just a ride in an amusement park.” 

T=You’re still telling yourself that as the ghost plucks you off your feet. 

T=His black lips part. 

T=He opens his mouth — wider and wider. 
T=Until it’s as wide as an entrance to a cave. 

T=Then he stuffs you inside. 

T=Instantly, you feel lightheaded, then light all over. 
T=You peek down at your hands. 

T=You can see straight through them. You’ve been turned into a ghost! 
T=And as your senses fade, you hear a distant bell chime twelve times. Too bad. 
T=The Carnival of Horrors will be one of your favorite haunts — forever!
