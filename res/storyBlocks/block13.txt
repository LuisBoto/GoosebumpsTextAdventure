T=“We’re in a prison,” Patty says. “And look at the prisoners! They’re weird!” 

T=Patty is right. As your eyes grow accustomed to the darkness, you see cell after cell. 
T=Each one holds a strange-looking prisoner. 
T=There’s an enormous fat lady who’s nearly busting out of the bars. 
T=A giant. A dwarf. A young lady with boa constrictors wrapped around her waist. 
T=And a woman with a long black beard! 

T=“We’re the freakssss,” the Snake Lady says. 
T=“Every night when the sssshow endssss, the masssster lockssss ussss up.” 

T=“The master? You mean Big A1 is —” you start to say. 

T=“You must help us!” the giant interrupts. 

T=“Sssssssh,” the Snake Lady says.
T=“The master’sssss coming — you musssstn’t be here! Go! That way!” 
T=She points to a door down the hall.
