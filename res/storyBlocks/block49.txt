T=But the dumb parrot flies over and latches onto your shoulder. 

T=“Ouch! That hurts,” you cry. 

T=“Free spin, free spin, you’re going on a free spin.” 

T=“Turn me loose,” you command.
T=When you swivel your head to glare at the bird, a scream freezes in your throat. 
T=The parrot has ballooned into an enormous vulture. 
T=His black, beady eyes pierce right through you. 
T=He digs his razor-sharp claws deeper into your shoulder. 

T=Run! — your every survival instinct shouts.
T=But the bird of prey has other ideas. 
T=One of them is dinner — with you as the main course. 

T=The big bird snatches you by the back of your shirt as if you were a rag doll. 
T=Kicking and screaming and using every defensive move you learned from karate class, you struggle for your life. 
T=But it’s no use. With a jerk he lifts you off the ground. 

T=And suddenly you have a frightening view of the carnival from twenty feet ...
T=thirty feet... fifty feet up.
