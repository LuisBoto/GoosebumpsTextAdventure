T=“Let’s bike over to Bennet’s Field and watch them set up the carnival!”
T=“I don’t know,” you answer. “It’s getting dark, and Mom said I have to be in by nine.”
T=“It’s only a quick bike ride,” Brad says. “Are you some kind of wimp?”
T=Brad calling you a wimp? You can’t believe it!
T=“Okay. Okay,” you agree. “But if it’s as bad as last year, there won’t be much to see. 
T=Don’t you remember the main attraction?” you remind them. 
T=“The ride they called Terror Track? It turned out to be a baby choo-choo train that circled around and around and around.”
T=It doesn’t matter what you say. Patty’s made up her mind. You’re going to ride over to the carnival.
T=A hot, humid breeze blows in your face as you pedal along. Patty’s in the lead. No surprise. 
T=And Brad’s puffing behind you. It’s dark by the time you reach Bennet’s Field.
T=You and your friends drop your bikes in the grass and race across the moonlit field, 
T=toward the huge wooden fence that surrounds the carnival.
