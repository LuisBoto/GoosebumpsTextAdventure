T=Quickly, you snap off the lid and the green gunk pours out. 

T=“Look! It’s alive!” Brad shouts. 

T=He’s right. 
T=The Monster Blood oozes from the can, quivers, and appears to stretch and pull itself up! 
T=Then it starts to roll and bounce, making horrible sucking sounds. 

T=Great! It’s rolling into the crowd, sucking up everything in its path! 

T=“Run!” Big A1 screams as the huge green ball rolls over the people in the crowd — 
T=sucking them up with a loud plop. 

T=Then the Monster Blood hits the side of the tent. It changes direction. 

T=It’s coming after you!
