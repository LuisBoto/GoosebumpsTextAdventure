T=“Let’s see what it says.” 
T=The three of you race through the wet grass.
T=Your socks are drenched. And your sneakers squeak as you run. 
T=But that’s not the sound that’s sending chills down your spine. 

T=It’s the hissing. It’s growing louder. 

T=“I’m not sure I want to read that sign,” you call out to Patty and Brad. 

T=“I know what you mean!” Patty shouts back. 
T=“I have a feeling we’re not going to like what it says.” 

T=And you don’t. You reach the sign and read it aloud. 
T=“Reptile Petting Zoo! Whoever heard of a Reptile Petting Zoo! What kind of carnival is this anyway?” 
T=“This carnival is e-evil,” Brad stammers. 

T=You’re about to agree when you notice the grass in front of you is swaying. 
T=Something is slithering through it. Something big. And then it comes into view. 
T=“Snake!” Brad cries. 

T=You know you have to run — but which way? 
Q=Left or right? > left_125/right_12
