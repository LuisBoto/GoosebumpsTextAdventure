T=The fortune-teller said this number might save your life. But how? 

T=Then you see it. In the corner. 
T=A tall silver locker with the number 132 painted in red. 

T=“In here,” you say, opening the door to the locker. 
T=You push Patty and Brad inside. 

T=As soon as you close the door, the locker begins to rattle and shake. 
T=You’re nearly blinded by a bright, white light. 
T=You hear a loud whooshing sound. And then all is silent. 
T=The door pops open — and you’re amazed at what you see. 


C=21
