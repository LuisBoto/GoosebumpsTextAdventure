T=You head toward the Boat Trip to Nowhere. 
T=At the dock, you spot a stubby guy with long arms slouching against one of the mooring posts. 
T=In the strange light of the swamp, his skin shines with an oily, green glow. 
T=And his ears and nose are as craggy as tree bark. 

T=“Step right up,” he calls in a gravelly voice. 

T=He pulls one of the motorboats over. It’s red with a silver racing stripe! 
T=“You can do fifteen knots in these babies,” he says. 
T=“But stay away from the tree stumps.” 

T=You watch the little man’s sharp green fingernails tearing the mooring rope apart. 
T=As soon as the boat is free, you jump in, step on the gas, and roar away from the dock. 

T=The wind blows hard against your face. You’re flying over the water. 
T=This is totally cool! You head for a channel that you see up ahead. 
T=Too bad you didn’t notice that sign that reads: to booger bog.
