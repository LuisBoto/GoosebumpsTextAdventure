T=The blood pounds in your temples. 

T=You’re sure they’re going to find you. But you’re trapped now.

T=You want to strangle him! 

T=“Four, five ...” 

T=Suddenly, the kiddie train starts to move. 

T=“Six ... seven ... eight ...” 

T=You sit up and what you see is the biggest shock of this whole horrible night....
