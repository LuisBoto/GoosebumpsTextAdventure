T=You’re not fast enough to get away from the ghost. 
T=You’re running now, but the ghost swoops down in front of you. 
T=You plow into him — and pass right through him! 

T=The carnival people are swarming after you. 
T=They don’t want you to leave the carnival. 

T=“Hurry!” you yell to your friends — only three minutes to midnight! 
T=You dash off in one direction, then another. 
T=The carnival people are approaching from every which way. 
T=They carry torches with flames that leap high in the air. 

T=You steal a glance at your watch — 11:58. 

T=“We can’t let them catch us!” you scream. “Let’s hide!” 

T=But where can you hide? Up ahead you see a gigantic cannon. 
T=All three of you could fit easily in there. 

T=You also spot a baby ride — the baby choo-choo train — maybe you could squeeze into that. 

Q=Quick! Pick one — and hope for the best. > cannon_130/choo choo_128
