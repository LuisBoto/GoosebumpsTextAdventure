T=“We’ve got to jump,” you tell Patty and Brad. “It’s our only chance.” 
T=“Okay,” Brad agrees as your cart inches up to the chopping elves. 

T=“Come on,” you cry. “Now!” But Brad is too paralyzed with fear to move. 
T=You and Patty grab him and haul him toward the side of the cart. 

T=Your cart has reached the elves! One of them smirks as he lifts his ax. 

T=It’s right above your neck. 

T=You picture your head tumbling down the side of the mountain. 

T=With a loud cry, all three of you jump. 
T=You land with a thud on a rocky ledge. 
T=It breaks your fall. But the rock is too weak to hold all of you. 

T=You scream again as the edge tears loose and the world drops from under your feet. 
T=You tumble over and over, down the side of the mountain.
