T=You wander over to the Wheel of Chance and immediately notice two strange things. 

T=First, you read the sign on the booth. It says “Wheel of No Chance.” 
T=Then you hear the barker’s voice calling, “Step right up!” But there’s no one there. 

T=No one but a green-and-yellow parrot. 

T=“Excuse me,” you say, hoping someone will answer. “Is this game open?” 

T=“No, I’m standing by this wheel for my health,” the parrot cracks. 
T=“Now, do you want to spin or what?” 

T=The parrot is obviously annoyed. “Mammals,” he mutters. 
T=“Can’t live with them, can’t live without them.” 

T=You steal a glance around. Maybe you should skip this game. 
T=But Big A1 sneaks up behind you. 

T=“Spin,” he says. “You must earn enough points to win.” 

T=“But how will I know if I have enough points?” you ask. 

T=“Spin!” It’s his final word.
