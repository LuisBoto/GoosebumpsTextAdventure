T=Sorry. It’s not your lucky day. 
T=As you dash toward the sign, the giant crane scoops the three of you up and drops you off into a hollowed-out log. 
T=You barely have time to sit up straight before the craft reaches the waterfall! 

T=You hold your breath as the log teeters on the fall’s edge.
T=As it plunges over, you scream. 

T=A hard spray smacks you in the face and drenches your clothing as you race down the long slide. 
T=At the bottom, the log hits a pool of water and sinks. 

T=You’re still holding your breath as you wait to bob to the surface again. 
T=But it never happens. You keep going down. 

T=Your last thought is that you’re going to set a world’s record for holding your breath underwater. 

T=You’d better set a world’s record for closing the book and starting over again. 
T=Maybe next time you dive in you’ll have better luck. 


E=THE END 
C=0
