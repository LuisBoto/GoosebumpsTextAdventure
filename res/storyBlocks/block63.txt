T=Bump. 

T=A chute opens up. You land headfirst on soft grass. 

T=You blink several times. A long sigh escapes from your lips. 
T=It wasn’t the Doom Slide after all. 

T=As you climb to your feet you hear someone call your name. 

T=You glance up and shout for joy. It’s Brad! And Patty’s there, too! 

T=You tell them about your scary ride on the slide — about how you thought you’d slide forever. 

T=“Cool!” Patty exclaims. “Let’s all ride it this time!” 

T=“No!” you tell her. “This carnival is too weird. And dangerous. 
T=Something’s not right. We have to get out of here. Now!” 

T=“Yeah,” Brad agrees. “The faster, the better.” 

T=“I have an idea,” Patty announces. You and Brad huddle around her. 
T=“I spotted a back way out of here. But it’s a little risky. 
T=We have to squeeze through a barbed-wire fence — and it’s guarded by the carnival’s security forces. 
T=But we should try!” 

Q=Are you going to listen to Patty? > follow her_48/not take the back way out_86
