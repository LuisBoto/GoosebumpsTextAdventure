T=The ride stops. 

T=Dead. 

T=You are sitting in the dark. 

T=Nothing is moving. 

T=“Patty! Brad!” you call. 

T=Silence. 

T=Why don’t they answer? They have to be there. 

T=You try to twist around. 
T=But you’re locked in your harness and clamped in your headrest. 

T=Blinking in the dim light, your eyes dart to the left. 
T=Then to the right. You spot dozens of empty space rockets lining the walls. 
T=They seem to come in sections, making longer and shorter space rockets. 

T=Your mind starts working feverishly. 
T=Did your section detach from Patty and Brad’s section? 

T=Suddenly, the silence is shattered. 
T=Your seat lock grinds open, and you are released from your harness. 
T=You quickly spin around. Patty’s and Brad’s cars have disappeared! 
T=If this is all part of the ride, maybe you should hop out. 
T=But if the ride is broken, maybe you should wait for help. 
Q=What will you do? > wait for help_92/hop out of the car_111
