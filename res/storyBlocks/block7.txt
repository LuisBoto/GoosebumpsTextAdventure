T=You and Brad take off after Patty. You all stop in front of the roller coaster. 

T=“Wow!” Patty says as she gazes up at it. “It’s like a rocket to outer space!” 

T=Beyond the roller coaster, you spy a castle surrounded by a moat. 
T=And a spooky-looking haunted house sitting high atop a hill. 

T=“These are the coolest rides I’ve ever seen!” you say. 
T=“They still have that dumb choo-choo train over there,” you point out, 
T=“but we could ride this stuff all night and never go near it!” 

T=Patty grabs your arm and tugs you over to the other side of the carnival — to the midway. 
T=Brad races after you. 

T=“Hey! Where are all those dinky wooden booths from last year?” 
T=you ask as you gawk at the amazing games of chance. 

T=They’re gone. And in their place are giant video games and huge spinning wheels, 
T=studded with hundreds of blinking colored lights! 

T=“Get a load of that!” Brad suddenly cries out. 

T=You and Patty spin around. 

T=You can’t believe what you see!
