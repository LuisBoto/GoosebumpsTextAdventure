T=You slowly lower yourself onto the slide. 
T=You start to stretch out your legs when the bottom tilts underneath you and throws you forward. 
T=You’re sliding! Fast! 

T=The surface must be made of some kind of special material because you’re zooming down at top speed. 

T=You hold your breath as you fly through the blackness. 
T=A bump sends you bouncing into the air. You scream. And scream. 

T=When is it going to end? 

T=Oh, no! Could this be the Doom Slide? 

T=You hear screams echo in the darkness. You twist around. 
T=But you don’t see anyone. 

T=The ghostly screams grow louder — in front of you, next to you, behind you. 
T=Screaming and sliding. And sliding. Never stopping. 

T=You gasp for breath. And then you hear it. 

T=A voice cuts through the blackness. Through the screams. A voice that cries:
T=“Welcome to the rest of your life. Welcome to the Doom Slide!” 


E=THE END 
C=0
