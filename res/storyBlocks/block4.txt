T=“Wh-what do you mean?” Brad asks, trembling all over. 

T=“I just had an idea. A great idea,” the man replies. 
T=“I want you kids to stay and try out the rides before the grand opening tomorrow.” 

T=Patty’s eyes open wide. “Cool!” she says. 

T=“Are you sure it’s all right with the owner?” you ask. 

T=“I’m Big Al, the manager. And what I say around here goes.” 

T=Big Al digs around in his checkered jacket and pulls out three maps. 
T=He hands one to each of you. 

T=“Study them carefully,” he says. “If you have any questions, ask them now.” 

T=Your eyes fall upon the map. You have a question. 
T=But when you gaze up, Big Al is gone. He’s vanished! 

T=“A whole carnival to ourselves!” Patty exclaims. “Where should we start?” 

T=You stare down at your map once again. You notice that the carnival is split in half. 
T=On one side are the rides. Tons of them. 
T=On the other side is the midway, packed with games of chance and the Freak Show. 

Q=What will you try first? > go on the rides_34/check out the midway_77
