T=“This way!” You wave to Patty and Brad. 

T=The three of you turn to the left and keep running — straight into a pond! 

T=“Why didn’t you tell us to stop?” Patty whines. 

T=“Don’t complain to me!” you shout back. “We followed you through the fence!” 

T=You turn around and slog your way back to shore. 
T=Patty and Brad make it there first. You are a few feet away — when you see it. 

T=An alligator. 

T=With its mouth gaping open — revealing two rows of razor-sharp teeth. 

T=You freeze. 

T=Patty spots the alligator and yells, “Quick! There’s a log! Jump on it!” 

T=You scramble up on the log, but it’s no use. You’re still an easy target. 

T=The alligator opens its huge mouth even wider. 
T=He slithers right up to the log. And you can tell he’s ready. 
T=Ready to crunch down on you!
