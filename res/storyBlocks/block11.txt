T=You’ve decided to help the freaks. As you race down the midway, you spot Brad and Patty. 

T=“Listen, guys,” you tell them, lowering your voice. 
T=“We’ve got a problem. A big problem.” 

T=You take a deep breath and tell them all about Madame Zeno and the blue card. 

T=“So,” you finish saying, “somebody might need our help in the back of the Freak Show.” 

T=“What’s a freak?” Brad asks nervously. 

T=“Remember the poster we saw when we came in? 
T=The one with the three-headed man and the lady with the snake body?” you remind him. 

T=Brad bites down on his lip. “Are they really real?” 

T=“Sure they’re real,” Patty chimes in. “I once saw a bearded lady at the circus.” 

T=“I don’t know,” Brad says. “It sounds kind of creepy.” 

T=“Well, Madame Zeno said this was my fate. I’m going to help them — whatever they are. 
T=Are you guys in?” 

T=“You bet,” Patty answers, her eyes shining with excitement. 

T=“Okay, okay. I’ll go,” Brad mumbles. 

T=“Then let’s hurry!” you exclaim.
