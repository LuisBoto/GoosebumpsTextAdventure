T=“I don’t know,” you say. “I don’t think we should take any more risks. 
T=Especially not in this crazy carnival.” 

T=“Don’t you trust me?” Patty demands. Her eyes flash angrily. 

T=You glance at Brad. He stares at the ground. 

T=“I just have a bad feeling about this, Patty. Okay?” 

T=But Patty doesn’t answer. She throws her shoulders back and stands up taller. 
T=And taller. And taller. 

T=You gasp! Patty is growing! She’s nearly ten feet tall! 

T=She reaches out a long arm and grabs you by the wrist. 
T=Her nails dig deep into your skin. 

T=You can’t move. 

T=You scream as Patty continues to change. Her skin turns green and lumpy. 
T=Horns sprout from her head. And her teeth grow into sharp fangs. 

T=You remember the horrible monsters on the walls of the slide. 
T=Patty has turned into one of them! 

T=“Let me go. Please!” you plead. 

T=“Too bad you didn’t trust me,” she growls. 
T=“I can’t have you ruining my plans.” Her nails sink deeper into your flesh. 

T=“Ha-ha-ha!” she cackles. 
T=Then she wraps her slimy mouth around your arm and bites down. Hard!
