T=Thrumpff! Your foot plows into the doctor’s stomach again. 
T=But this time, it smashes right through it. And hits ... solid steel! 

T=The crunch of metal echoes in the room — along with the doctor’s screams. 
T=“Aiiii!” he wails like a siren. 

T=You gaze into the gaping hole your sneaker made. 
T=Thousands of circuits and wires burn and crackle inside it. 
T=The doctor is a robot! Well, an ex-robot now. 
T=Your kick totally destroyed him. 

T=That’s the good news. 

T=The bad news is headed for you. 
T=It’s the monster with the blue horns and red, bulging eyes. 

T=You scramble out of the net and dash toward the door. 
T=But the monster is too quick for you. His tentacle arms shoot out and snatch you. 
T=Giant suckers at the ends of his wrists circle your throat. 

T=You gasp for air as the monster pins you against the wall. 
T=Can you free yourself from his oozing grasp?
