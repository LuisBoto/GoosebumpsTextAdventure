T=You grab the sides of the slide and lower yourself down. 
T=The second you sit, the slide’s floor tilts up beneath you and propels you forward. 

T=You shriek! 

T=You raise your arms and scream louder. You slide faster and faster. 
T=In total darkness. Darkness so black, you can’t even see your own feet in front of you. 

T=Your eyes dart frantically from side to side. 
T=Faces suddenly appear in the darkness in bright flashes of light. 
T=Faces of hideous monsters with deformed heads and oozing flesh. 

T=But you’re moving too fast to focus on them. 
T=You slide and slide — until the faces stop flashing and you’re covered in the thick, heavy blackness again. 

T=You scream as you round a sharp curve. Your head is spinning. 
T=You pick up speed. 

T=When will it end? 

T=Then you hear the screams. Chilling screams that echo through the darkness. 

T=Oh, no! You must have picked the Doom Slide!
