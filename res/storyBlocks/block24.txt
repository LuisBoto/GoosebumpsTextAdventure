T=Carnival workers. 
T=The carnival workers who set up the same rinky-dink carnival you go to every summer. 

T=You can’t believe your eyes. You must be seeing things! 

T=Patty tries to say something smart, but the only thing she manages is “Huh?” 

T=“Hey, kids!” a worker yells at you. 
T=“Get away from that ride. The carnival doesn’t start till tomorrow night.” 

T=You gaze around in wonder at the faded games, the baby rides, the tacky food stands. 
T=For the first time in your life, it all looks great! 

T=“We’ll be there!” you shout as you head for your bikes. 
T=“This is the greatest carnival I’ve ever seen!” 


E=THE END
