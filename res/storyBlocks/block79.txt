T=The doctor leans over. He’s so close now, his sour breath fills your nostrils. 
T=Then his fingertips brush your hand and — POW! 
T=Your foot flies into his stomach! A direct hit! 

T=But nothing happens. 

T=He doesn’t scream. He doesn’t even moan. 
T=In fact, he doesn’t seem to notice at all. 

T=He simply smiles at you. 

T=Now you’re scared. Really scared. 
T=But you know you have to do whatever it takes to get out of there. 
T=You have to find your friends and escape from this Carnival of Horrors. 

T=You gather up every ounce of courage and strength you have — and kick him once more. Harder! 

T=And this time something does happen — BIG TIME!
