T=You dig deep into the side pocket of your jeans — and find it!
T=The chocolate bar you won. 

T=It’s a good thing you didn’t eat it all — but will the vulture go for it? 

T=Without warning, the big bird starts his final approach, diving straight for the nest. 
T=You pull out the candy and wave it frantically in front of him. 
T=“Treat! Treat!” you holler. These words make your dog at home go wild. 
T=But will it work on the vulture? 

T=Yes! He cracks open his claws — just enough for you to wiggle loose.
T=Then you’re falling, falling. 

T=You’ve landed on a giant trampoline. 

T=Fwanggg! 

T=Now you’re going up again. Higher this time. Now you’re falling again. 

T=Fwanggg — you’ve bounced up even higher this time. 

T=Every life has its ups and downs, but it looks as if you’ll be bouncing up and down forever.
T=And boy, is it fun! 


E=THE END! 
E=THE END!
