T=You leap out of the boat. The putrid brown water splashes into your mouth. 
T=Gross! 

T=You swim a few strokes and suddenly find your knees scraping the bottom of the bog. 
T=The water here is less than a foot deep. Unbelievable! 
T=You were practically inches away from safety the entire time! 

T=Slogging through the brown foam, you wade to shore. 
T=Your clothes are dripping wet and smell like a sewer. 
T=Well, look at the bright side, you remind yourself. 
T=At least you didn’t go down with your boat. 

T=But your troubles aren’t over yet. 
T=You’re standing in a dank, eerie forest that surrounds the lake. 
T=Creepy screeches echo through the night mist. And you’re totally lost. 

T=The wind starts to blow. 
T=Shivering, you wrap your arms around your shoulders and wonder where your friends are and what they are doing. 

T=Then — POW! Something black and furry swoops down at you! 
T=You duck your head, but it comes at you again and again. 

T=A huge bat!
