T=You open the blue door and peer through. 
T=You’re staring down a long dark passageway. At least you think it’s long. 
T=It’s difficult to tell. It’s pitch-black. You don’t know what to do. 

T=“Maybe I should have picked the other door,” you say to yourself. 
T=“I’m getting out of here!” 

T=But the blue door has locked behind you! Now you’re sure you made the wrong choice. 
T=But there’s nowhere to go but forward. 

T=Your knees begin to tremble as you inch your way down the dark hallway. 

T=The passage ends in a bright burst of light. 
T=And in front of you, a tall purple mountain rises hundreds of feet into the air. 

T=You breathe out a long sigh of relief. You’re out of the dark! 

T=You study the mountain. 
T=It looks so real! But cut into its side, you spot a doorway. 
T=Above it a brightly painted sign reads: 
T=DOOM SLIDE - WILL YOU BE THE ONE TO SLIDE FOREVER?
