T=Blue is your favorite color. You turn the blue card over. 

T=There is a message: Help us! You are our only hope. 
T=Hurry to the back door of the freak show. Signed, The Freaks. 

T=“What does this mean?” you ask Madame Zeno. 
T=She stares deep into your eyes. Her lips tremble. She leans forward. 
T=She’s about to speak. 

T=And then the lights go out — and a blood-curdling scream rips through the dark! 

T=You start to bolt for the door when a dim light suddenly flickers. 
T=You stare across the table. Madame Zeno is gone! 

T=You reach out to take the card. And it bursts into red-hot flames! 
T=In seconds, the entire tent fills with thick smoke. 
T=Flames shoot across the floor. You run for the door. 

T=Outside, you gulp the fresh air. Whew! You made it. 

T=You glance back. No smoke. No fire. No tent! 
T=Everything has disappeared! 
Q=What should you do now? > Help the freaks_11/Do not help them_113
