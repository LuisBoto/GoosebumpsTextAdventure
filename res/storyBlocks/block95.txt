T=You sit down on the slide and push off. 
T=The world tilts as you plunge down. Down, down, down. 

T=You’re scared. But you can’t help feeling that this is kind of cool! 
T=Sliding and swirling in the darkness. 

T=Until you hear the screams. The eerie screams that follow you as you twist and turn. 

T=Your heart starts pounding wildly. 
T=Oh, no! You must have picked the Doom Slide. You’re going to slide forever! 

T=And then, bump. 

T=A chute opens up. You hit the ground hard. 
T=You tumble over and over and finally stop. 

T=You lie on the ground. Panting. 

T=You’re outside! 

T=You scramble to your feet and gaze around. 

T=You hear laughter. It seems to be coming from the bright pink building a few feet in front of you. 

T=You walk over to its big pink door and press your ear against it. 

T=Yes. The laughter is definitely coming from inside.
